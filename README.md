# DatabaseApps-Teamwork
The Teamwork Project for the DB Apps Course at Software University - Team "Sunflower Sunlight"

Due to the fact that MySQL and SQLite require external programs to connect,for the time been they
have been moved to 'Problem 7 and 8' with different project. Once they are finished I'll try to
integrate them in the main program. By them been in separate location the work-flow will be easier,
since others will not need to install the external programs in order to compile and work on the rest
of the poject.
